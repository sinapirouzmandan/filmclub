# 🎬 FilmClub

**A social media platform for cinema enthusiasts**  
Built with **Vue.js** and **Express.js**

I led the development of FilmClub, a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed for movie lovers, allowing users to engage in discussions, follow others, and create personal movie playlists. The platform also evolved into an Android app via **Trusted Web Activity (TWA)**, reaching a milestone of **2,000 registered users** before it was unfortunately shut down due to financial constraints.

## 📁 What's Included in This Repo

This repository contains **only the frontend of the main application** built with **Vue.js**. It does not include backend code or the admin panel. For those interested in the full-stack functionality, backend services were developed separately using **Express.js**.

---

While the project was discontinued, the experience gained from leading the development of FilmClub has been invaluable, especially in overseeing both frontend and backend tasks with the support of another backend developer.

### 🚀 Future Plans
If revisited, future improvements could include expanding the platform’s financial model to ensure sustainability, enhancing user engagement tools, and exploring new social media features.
